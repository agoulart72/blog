    <p> <strong>Hello!</strong> This is the first post I'm writing. </p>
    <p> As I'm learning new technologies, I decided to write it down, just in case I may return here to refresh my memory. I decided to start it
      slowly and ver simple. A plain HTML page with everything static. </p>
    <p> I looked over the internet for blog softwares, all I did found was "Wordpress" everywhere. What the heck, if I'm going to write down a blog
        about technology, I'm not going to use the same thing as everybody. I will write my own pages using the new techs I'm studying.
